						  <span class="title-under"></span></h2>

					<p style="text-align:justify;">
					   NGAS identified dropout children and child labourers in the villages and towns. They have been brought to bridge school. In the bridge school, NGAS has provided nutritional support to 100 children(both girls and boys), since they are deprived of nutritional food in their homes. These children hail from a poor socio-economic background.  As a result, the children’s nutritional food intake has improved and they are more focused on their studies. After 12 months of stay, they have been mainstreamed into normal school. 100% of these children were enrolled into Govt schools.Most of the marginalized children are now enrolled in Morarji Desai, Kittur Rani Chennamma Residential School, SC/ST/OBC Hostels. The burden of educational expenses on their parents ,is now gone. These children and staff of these schools have now taken responsibility to report to the Board on any action taken ,as a follow up measure.
